# 🧠 Plagiarism Detection Tool

This is a Flask-based web application that performs **plagiarism detection using n-gram containment** and Google Search results (via SerpAPI). The tool processes input text, extracts meaningful content, and compares it against top search results for similarity scoring.

### 📁 Project Structure

- `run.py` – Main Flask application  
- `text_filter.py` – NLP utilities for stopword removal and POS tagging  
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for deployment and local use  
- `Procfile` – Tells Heroku how to start the app  
- `runtime.txt` – *(Optional)* Specifies Python version for Heroku  
- `.env` – Environment variables (e.g., SerpAPI key – **not committed**)  
- `templates/` – Contains HTML templates  
  - `index.html` – Search input form with Bootstrap styling and spinner  
  - `results.html` – Displays similarity results in a styled table

### 🧪 How It Works

1. **User submits** a block of text through the web form.
2. The app **cleans the text** using NLTK:
   - Converts to lowercase
   - Removes stopwords
   - Keeps only relevant parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
3. The cleaned query is sent to **SerpAPI**, which returns the top 4 Google search results.
4. Each result is fetched and parsed using **BeautifulSoup**.
5. The app computes **n-gram containment** between the input and each result.
6. A table is shown with:
   - 🔗 Source URLs (clickable)
   - 📊 Similarity percentages
